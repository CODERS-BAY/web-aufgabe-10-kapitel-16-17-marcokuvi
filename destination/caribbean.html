                            The Caribbean is brimming with beautiful marine life including bottlenose dolphins, coral, rays, turtles and rainbow-coloured tropical fish. Hiring the equipment is easy and reasonable and there are also plenty of places offering tuition. The sea is warm
                            and blissfully clear, making discovering reefs, tropical fish and turtles a pleasurable pastime.

                            The blissfully pale shimmery stretches of sand and the sparkling crystal clear waters are obvious pulls when it come to visiting the Caribbean. Throw in the glorious weather and you have one idyllic holiday location. The weather remains pretty good all
                            year round, only breaking for the occasional storm or hurricane.

                            Festivals are very important in the Caribbean and they reflect the rich cultural diversity and history of the region. If you love colour, costume and carnival then you’ll revel in the Trinidad and Tobago festivals. With the steel drum bands and all night
                            partying and dancing you’ll have a whale of a time. The revellery at Noo Saro-Wiwajoin being the forefathers to Notting Hill Carnival. The brilliant sunshine and sandy beaches just add to the festival ambience. Want to find
                            more festivals? Try music festivals like the St. Lucia and Barbados Jazz and Jamaica Reggae Festivals to the lesser-known Mashramani in Guyana, Surifesta in Suriname and Gimistory in Cayman Islands and the more religious-based
                            festivals like Hindu celebrated Phagwa and Diwali and Muslim Id-Ul-Fitr in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname.

                            If you think the carnival is colourful then you should see the sunsets, displaying every colour imaginable over shimmering reflective waters. Basking in the sunset makes for a very relaxing end to a beautiful day. Make sure you have a tropical juice cocktail
                            to hand and notch up the indulgence points.
