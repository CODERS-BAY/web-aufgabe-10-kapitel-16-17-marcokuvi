                            Two of the 17 species of penguins solely reside in the White Continent, the Emperor Penguins and the Adelie Penguins and like their regal name; these tuxedoed gentlemen rule the country with their goofy mating rituals and silly antics. With up to 250,000
                            of them gathering in one breeding area, there is no shortage of non-feathered friends to observe.

                            Whether you want to admire the ice formations from afar or scale them, grab your crampons and an ice pick and get mountaineering. Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic is thicker, taller, heavier and older than anywhere else on Earth and the billowing statues
                            change so much you will never encounter the same design twice. But don’t be fooled, even with all the ice and frozen tundra, Antarctica is still classified as a desert climate.

                            Often overlooked, Antarctica's undersea is an environment even more amazing than what resides on the surface. Described by oceanographers as a “"riot of life," species exist in the depths of the Antarctic Ocean that exist nowhere else on earth. Researchers
                            discovered new kinds of crabs, an albino octopus, and alien fish species.

                            At least ten species of whales, six species of seals and three breeds of dolphins have been spotted in the Antarctic Ocean. These whales include humpback (the most common), minke, right, blue, sei, finback, orca, pilot, sperm, and southern bottle-nosed.
                            The largest mammals on the planet, catch these magnificent creatures as they travel alone or in pods.

                            A mud map is an old Australian saying which means unexplored and uncharted territory. Back in the day, early explorers used to draw directions and compasses in the dirt to provide guidance to other travelers. While you won’t be left to wander on your
                            own, small group guides can take you off-the-beaten-path to discover the secrets of the White continent.
