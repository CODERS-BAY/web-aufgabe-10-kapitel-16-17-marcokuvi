                            Made up of two main islands and a host of smaller ones, New Zealand has an amazing range of breathtaking scenery, from subtropical forests, beaches, and offshore islands in the north to glaciers, lakes, snow-covered mountains, and large flat plains in
                            the south. There are also fjords, volcanoes, hot springs, and beautiful rolling green pastures, a diversity like no other place on earth.

                            "Kiwis," as the locals are called, are a friendly bunch and very welcoming to visitors. A wide range of cultures is represented here, but New Zealand is an ex-British colony and the European influence remains strong. There's also a unique accent.

                            New Zealand split from the large landmass that once joined Australia and Antarctica about 85 million years ago. As a result, bird and plant species can be found here that exist nowhere else in the world. Forests are full of an abundance of interesting
                            plant life, from the towering ancient kauri trees to fronds of nikau palms. You might even see a kiwi, the small, flightless bird that has become New Zealand's national symbol.

                            There's nothing easier than hopping in a car or RV, known locally as a campervan, and heading off on a New Zealand adventure. The country has a great road network, and every town has an information center to help tourists if you need directions or advice
                            on the local attractions or on where to stay for less money. Fuel is much cheaper here than in Europe, and there's also an excellent intercity bus network covering the entire country. Distances between towns and attractions
                            are not too great.
