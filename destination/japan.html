                            All the beautiful ancient Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines are reason enough to visit Japan. One of the best-preserved cities in Japan, Kyoto offers something like 2,000 Buddhist temples and shrines within the limits of the Kansai Region city, while
                            Nara is home to no less than 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and to some of the best temples not only in Nara Prefecture, but in the country. You should see them with your eyes, they look just stunning!

                            You won’t see any litter or a discarded cup or cigarette butt anywhere, the streets smell nice and the bus drivers wear white gloves. Like, white white. Like, how-is-that-even-possible white. Japan is so clean you could safely lick the sidewalks, and
                            they will probably taste like nori. Even Tokyo is so clean to the point where it almost looks brand new! Japan is the window into the future where people respect their surroundings.

                            Japan is filled with perfect landscapes scattered across the country for people to soak in its beauty. For many people, the image that immediately springs to mind in conjunction with Japan is actually skyscrapers, bright neon lights and advanced technology,
                            but there’s a lot more to Japan than its urban landscapes. The stunning spectacle of Mount Fuji, the magnificent sight of Arashiyama bamboo Forest, the many temples and gardens and the magnificent rugged mountains make Japan
                            an ideal destination for nature lovers all year round.

                            They make cartooned versions of everything, they make plastic food look incredible, they have the weirdest flavors of food ever, they have bizarre and strangely addictive music videos. They invented banana slipcase, square watermelons, baby mops and cuddle
                            pillows. They have toilets that talk to you, blow dry your bum, and even play music for you (both to relax and mask) while you do your business. Yep, that was a weird moment.

                            Japanese people all just seem to be little rays of sunshine. They’re polite, they’re gracious and they somehow remember your name after only meeting you once (I so do not have the same talent), and they’re always fun to talk to! The language barrier is
                            difficult at times, but they will do ANYTHING to help you. I’ve met some great people and having to leave them so soon indefinitely was the hardest part about leaving.
